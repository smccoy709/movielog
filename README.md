# movielog
The movie log will be used to track movies a user has seen.  Every time a user sees a movie, they can add the title of the movie to the movie log.

To use the movie log, click the purple "+" sign below the log, and a sidebar with a form will open.  Type in the name of the movie that you'd like to add to the log and then hit the submit button.  Refresh the browser and the new movie will be added to the log.
