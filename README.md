# movielog
The movie log will be used to track movies a user has seen or would like to view in the future.  Click the "+" under the list of the movies in the log to open a side bar.  The side bar will display a form a user can utilize to enter a movie title and its synopsis.  They can submit the form to add it to their log.

A user must first create an account to utilize the Movie Log.  Then, they must be logged into their account to upload movies into their log.  If they are not logged in, they won't be able to successfully upload a movie to the log.  The user is also able to log out of their account if they no longer want to be logged in, but anything in their log will not be visible to them unless they log back in.
