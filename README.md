# movielog
The movie log will be used to track movies that a user would like to see or have seen.  If a user is using the log to track which movies they'd like to watch, they can delete a movie from the log so they can no longer have it in the list.  They can add new movies to the log, as well, as they can add movies they have either watched or they'd like to watch, dependent on what they are using the movie log to track.

A user can using the purple + button to open a side bar to add a new movie (I don't think working JavaScript is required for this part of the assignment) to the log.  The user can view the nav bar at the upper right part of the Homepage to read an about the movie log description or how to contact to the movie log support team.  They can also delete a movie from the log using the trash can icon on each, individual movie that has been added to the log (again, it never states working JavaScript is necessary for this assignment so I didn't incorporate it).
