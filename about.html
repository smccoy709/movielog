        <p class="purple-text text-darken-2">
            The movie log is a comprehensive list, otherwise known as a log, that movie buffs can utilize to
            track movies any way they choose to do so.  Movie buffs can log the movies they have seen, log the 
            movies that they like or dislike, or simply movies that they wish to see that are coming out.
        </p>
        <p class="purple-text text-darken-2">
            The movie log, if utilized to track movies that the movie buff wishes to see, can delete an entry into 
            the log so if they have seen it, they can choose to remove it from the log completely.  The movie buff 
            can click the add button to open a side bar to add a new movie to the log.
        </p>
        <p class="purple-text text-darken-2">
            The movie log is automatically defaulted by two of the most iconic films in cinema history:  Titanic and
            Halloween.  Both films reached standings with fans worldwide and the defaulted movies listed can also be
            deleted if the movie buff wishes to do so.
